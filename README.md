# rpeabody43.github.io
I made this in 7th grade with Unity2D, I rediscovered it 3 years later when I actually wanted to make a github account.
I didn't even know what a repository was supposed to do. I thought it was a hosting thing for the index.html, which I think was just so I could have a nicer link to bring up in class.
I'm keeping this up on my profile forever, can't forget where your programming adventure started.
