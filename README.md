# 7th Grade Vocab Project
I made this in 7th grade with Unity2D, I rediscovered it 3 years later when I actually wanted to make a github account.
I didn't even know what a repository was supposed to do. I saw some independent websites end with .github.io or something and thought it was a hosting thing. The only reason I'm pretty sure to make the index.html and host it here was just so I could have a nicer link to bring up in class. 

If I ever find the Unity project folder somewhere I'll put it here

I'm keeping this up on my profile forever, can't forget where your programming adventure started.
